# Airbnb SVM Regression
Airbnb is a popular platform for renting out homes or rooms to travelers. However, one of the challenges faced by Airbnb hosts is determining the appropriate price for their rental property. This is due to the lack of property standardization, the influence of the buyer's market, and the absence of reliable appraisal tools. In this project, I aimed to create an SVM regression that can suggest accurate prices to Airbnb hosts based on various features of the dataset. I found the data from a Kaggle Airbnb dataset. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/airbnb-prices-in-european-cities

## Machine Learning Approach
We used Support Vector Machine (SVM) regression in RStudio to create a model that can predict the appropriate price for an Airbnb listing. SVM regression is a powerful machine learning tool that works by finding the hyperplane that maximizes the margin between data points in a given feature space. The model takes multiple input variables and outputs a numerical value that predicts the response variable. SVM regression can handle both linear and non-linear data and uses different kernel functions to map data points into a higher-dimensional space where a linear separation can be achieved. We explored three commonly used kernel functions: linear, polynomial, and radial.

## Conclusion
After many revisions, I noticed the non-normal distribution of the response variable seemed to cause so many problems in the model. So I decided to normally distributed the response variable with logarithmic scaling. Logarithmically scaling the response variable led to a near perfect model, with a training set MAPE of 10%, and a testing set MAPE of 5.5%. The model was extremely good at calculating the price of an airbnb in logarithmic form thanks to the normal distribution. Unfortunately, the business use case of the response variable in this form isn’t very practical. And among scaling the predictions back, they became non-normally distributed once again. Leaving us with a mediocre MAPE of 27%, and an RMSE of 363. Some possible ways to get our MAPE down that I didn’t get to implement are:
- Experimenting with more scaling techniques on the response variable
- Applying a correction factor to adjust predictions and improve the accuracy of the results

Furthermore, the analysis of feature importance revealed that certain features were more important than others in determining the price of an Airbnb listing. Specifically, the room type was found to be the most important feature, followed by if the room was public or private, and the person capacity. This information can be valuable for hosts to optimize the price of their rental properties and make data-driven decisions on how to improve their listings.
In summary, when working with Support Vector Machines it’s essential to scale the data to ensure that the features have similar ranges. Otherwise the SVM can place too much weight on certain features, which can negatively impact the model's performance. Additionally, SVMs can be time-consuming to train, so if time is a constraint, another model may be a better option. Finally, if the response variable is not normalized, it may be worth exploring other models that don’t require normalization. A non-normalized response variable may lead to poor model performance. While SVMs can be powerful models for certain types of data, it's important to carefully consider the data and use case before deciding whether an SVM is the right choice.
